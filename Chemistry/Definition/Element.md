#chem 
A [[substance]] that cannot be broken down into two or more simpler substances by any means.
## Examples
- Gold
- Oxygen

## Chemical Properties

Chemical properties are determined mostly by the number of [[proton]]s and elections in its [[atom]]s and not the number of [[neutron]]s. This means different [[isotopes]] of an element exhibit similar chemical properties.
