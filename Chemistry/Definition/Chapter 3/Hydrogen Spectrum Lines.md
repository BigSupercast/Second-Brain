[[Atomic Line Spectra]] is the light spectrum that an element can emit. Each element is different, and hydrogen got easy to understand formulas to find its lines.
## Hydrogen Spectral Lines

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_\infty(\frac{1}{n^2_1}-\frac{1}{n^2_2})$$ Calculates the the wavelengths of the four visible lines in the emission spectrum of hydrogen. This allows us to calculate visible wavelengths and all hydrogens spectral lines. 
- $\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength]]
- $R_\infty$ is the [[Rydberg Constant]] ($1.09737316\times10^7m^{-1}$)
- n is a positive integer where $n_2>n_1$

## Finding Electron energies

We can find the electron energy levels in each shell of the hydrogen [[atom]] with
$$E_n=-2.18\times10^{-18}J(\frac{1}{n^2})$$

If the equation results in a negative number, then it means the energy in the atom is *lower* than the [[energy]] of a *free electron*, which is an electron that is infinitely far from the nucleus. 

As the [[electron]] gets closer to the nucleus (as n decreases), $E_n$ becomes larger in abs value, and more negative. 

So we can deduce that when n = 1, it is the lowest energy possible for the atom, making it the most stable. This is the [[ground state]]. ^09c941

When n > 1 it is called the [[excited state]]. The further the electron is from the [[nucleus]] the more excited the electron is.

As the electron moves up energy levels (n) the more light ([[Photon]]s) are emitted. 

## Applying the emission process

- $E_i=\text{The initial energy level}$
- $E_f=\text{The final energy level}$
$$\Delta E=E_f-E_i$$
Knowing this we can find the change of energy level
$$\Delta E=h\nu=-2.18\times10^{-18}J(\frac{1}{n^2_f}-\frac{1}{n^2_i})$$
