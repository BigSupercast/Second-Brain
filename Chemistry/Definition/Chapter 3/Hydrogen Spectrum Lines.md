[[Atomic Line Spectra]] is the light spectrum that an element can emit. Each element is different, and hydrogen got easy to understand formulas to find its lines.
## Hydrogen Spectral Lines

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_\infty(\frac{1}{n^2_1}-\frac{1}{n^2_2})$$ Calculates the the wavelengths of the four visible lines in the emission spectrum of hydrogen. This allows us to calculate visible wavelengths and all hydrogens spectral lines. 
- $\lambda$ is the [[Wavelength]]
- $R_\infty$ is the [[Rydberg Constant]] ($1.09737316\times10^7m^{-1}$)
- n is a positive integer where $n_2>n_1$

## Finding Electron energies

We can find the electron energy levels in each shell of the hydrogen [[atom]] with
$$E_n=-2.18\times10^{-18}J(\frac{1}{n^2})$$

If the equation results in a negative number, then it means the energy in the atom is *lower* than the [[energy]] of a *free electron*, which is an electron that is infinitely far from the nucleus. 

As the [[electron]] gets closer to the nucleus (as n decreases), $E_n$ becomes larger in abs value, and more negative. 

So we can deduce that when n = 1, it is the lowest energy possible for the atom, making it the most stable. This is the [[ground state]]. ^09c941

When n > 1 it is called the [[excited state]]. The further the electron is from the [[nucleus]] the more excited the electron is.

As the electron moves up energy levels (n) the more light ([[Photon]]s) are emitted. 

## Applying the emission process

- $E_i=\text{The initial energy level}$
- $E_f=\text{The final energy level}$
$$\Delta E=E_f-E_i$$
Knowing this we can find the difference between the energies of the initial and final states
$$\Delta E=h\nu=-2.18\times10^{-18}J(\frac{1}{n^2_f}-\frac{1}{n^2_i})$$
remember a photon uses $h\nu$ ![[photon]]
- A [[photon]] is only emitted when $n_i>n_f$, so when $\Delta E$ is negative. [[Threshold Frequency]]
- A photon is absorbed when $n_f > n_i$, so when $\Delta E$ is positive. [[Threshold Frequency]]


The brightness of the spectral lines depend on how many photons of the same wavelength are emitted. 

## Wave length of Emission Lines

$$\frac{1}{\lambda}=\frac{2.18\times10^{-18}J}{hc} (\frac{1}{n^2_f}-\frac{1}{n^2_i})$$ Take the abs value of this answer because a wave can only be positive.

## Emission Series in the Hydrogen Spectrum
| Series | $n_f$ | $n_i$ | Spectrum Region |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Lyman | 1 | 2, 3, 4, ... | Ultraviolet |
| Balmer | 2 | 3, 4, 5, ... | Visible and ultraviolet |
| Paschen | 3 | 4, 5, 6, ... | Infrared |
| Brackett | 4 | 5, 6, 7, ... | Infrared |

 The difference between 1 and 2 is greater than the difference between 6 and 7.
