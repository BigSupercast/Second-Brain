#chem 

The smallest quantity of [[energy]] that can be emitted (or absorbed) in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]].

Max Planck discovered that radiant energy could only be emitted/absorbed in discrete quantities.

$$E=h\nu$$The Energy of a single quantum of energy. The h is the ![[Planck's constant]]
The $\nu$ is [[Frequency]]
Energy is always emitted in whole-number multiples of $h\nu$.
