The potential [[energy]] that results from the interaction of charged [[particle]]s. Its the energy generated by [[Coulomb's Law]].

$$E_{e1} \propto \frac{Q_1Q_2}{d}$$ The Product of two charges ($Q_1$ and $Q_2$ ) divided by the distance between them ($d$).
==If E = negative then it signifies attraction.==
==If E = positive then it signifies repulsion.==
