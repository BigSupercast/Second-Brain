The speed of a wave depends on the type of wave. Some waves move at the [[Speed of Light]] (c) through a vacuum. 
## Properties of Waves

^30f4b9
Waves are characterized by 
- [[Wavelength]] $\lambda$
- [[Frequency]] $\nu$
- [[Amplitude]]

## Equations

Speed, wavelength, frequency are related by 
$$ c = \lambda\nu$$
This equation gives us the answer in meters since the [[Speed of Light]] is in meters per second. But when working with wavelength we want it to be expressed in nm.
