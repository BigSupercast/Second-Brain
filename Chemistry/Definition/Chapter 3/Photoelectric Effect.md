A phenomenon in which [[electron]]s are ejected from the surface of a metal exposed to light of at least a certain minimum [[frequency]].

The light must be a minimum [[Frequency]] to eject the electrons called the [[Threshold Frequency]]

This effect could not be explained by [[wave]] theory, so Einstein came up with [[Photon]]s.

So when photons with enough energy (high frequency) hits a metal electrons will get loose. The higher the frequency above the [[Threshold Frequency]] the more [[Kinetic Energy]] that is generated  and we can see this from the equation

$$h\nu=E_k+\phi$$
$\phi$ is the work function of the electron in the metal. We can fin the Energy of the electron my moving the equation a bit. 

$$E_k=h\nu-\phi$$
