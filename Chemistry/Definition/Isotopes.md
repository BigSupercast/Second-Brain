#chem

[[Atom]]s that have the same [[atomic number (Z)]] but different [[Mass Number (A)|mass numbers (A)]].

Isotopes of an element exhibit similar chemical properties.
## Example

One [[proton]] will always be [[hydrogen]], but the mass number changes the type. Hydrogen is the only element with different names for its isotopes.
