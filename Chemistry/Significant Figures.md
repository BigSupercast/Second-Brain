## How to figure out how many
### When the measurement is written as a decimal
- Find the first nonzero digit, starting from the left.
- Count the digits from this digit all the way to the right, including any zeros.

### When the measurement is written in scientific notation
- Make sure the mantissa (the number that is being multiplied by x 10) is >= 1 but < 10 or if negative, <= -1 but > -10 ==we're checking if its one digit==
- Then count the digits in the mantissa, including any zeros


## Adding and subtracting (measurments)
When adding and subtracting only significant digits that are shared are in the answer, make sure to round up if needed

## Multiplication and Division (measurements)
The answer has the same number of significant digits as the measurement with the least numbers of significant digits. This may force you to use scientific notation.
