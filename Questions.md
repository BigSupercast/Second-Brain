1. What happens when you heat a cathode tube?
	1. Closes the electronic switch, activating the motor.
2. What happens when a vacuum tube rectifies a current?
	1.  Converts AC to DC
3. What's one application that rectifications makes possible? 
	- Public transit
	- Electroplating operations
	- Running Dc Speed Mills
	- Steel conveyor belt
	- Mining platinum
	- Perceptron (cleans air electrostatically)
4. When amplifying what happens when adding a negative charge to the input?
	1.  Reduces power
5.  When amplifying what happens when adding a positive charge to the input?
	1. Increases power
6. What does amplification allow for?
	1. Communication from further distances
7. What do control units rely on as inputs
	1. Variables such as temperature, speed, or time
8. What does the control units do to motors?
	1. Regulates motor speed
9. What is the main job of a transistor?
	1. To amplify current.
10. Do transistors take more or less energy than a vacuum tube?
	1. Transistors take less energy than a vacuum tube.
11. Temperature wise how do transistors differ from vacuum tubes?
	1. They stay cool, while vacuum tubes get very hot. 
12. What do transistors amplify?
	1. Current.
13. The amplification that transistors allow do what for making calls.
	1. Allows calls to have higher quality of further distances
14. Integrated circuits are many \_\_\_\_\_ that achieve a specific result.
	1. Transistors
15. What are the advantages of using an integrated circuit over many transistors?
	1. Its cheaper, more reliable, and faster.
