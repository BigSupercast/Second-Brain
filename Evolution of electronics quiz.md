# Vacuum Tube

Diode, two element electronic tube

It a single pulse switch

Heating the cathode and giving the anode positive potential closes the electronic switch and activates the moter.

## Six basic things that this switch can do

### 1. Rectify Current
Converting AC to DC

Changing AC to DC has many applications
- Public transit
- Electroplating operations
- Running Dc Speed Mills
- Steel conveyor belt
- Mining platinum
- Perceptron (cleans air electrostatically)

### 2. Amplify

We add a grid and an input that we will use to amplify

inputting negative charge reduces

Amplification application
- Allows communication from air planes and control stations
- Allows communication from individual tanks
- Allows the measurements of tiny voltages

### 3 Generator

Application
- Radio Transmitter
- Plates steal strips, using the heat by generation
- Bonding plastic and plywood quickly
- Cures plastic faster

### 4 Control

Automatically closes and opens switch based on a variable

Application
- Electronically controlled spot welder
- Steam welding
- Motor speed regulation

### 5 Transform light into electric current

Uses light for electronic emission

Application
- Television camera
- Product and process control

### 6 Transforms current into light

Application
- Cathode ray tub | makes television
- X-ray tube
- Florescent lighting

# Transistors

Amplifies current without a vacuum or heating elements

Takes much less energy than the vacuum tube.

Vacuum tubes get how while transistors stay cool. 

Very useful for calls from far distances because it amplifies the current allowing for more audible calls.

They are very small so things got smaller. 

Help makes smaller computers

# Integrated circuit


Many transistors in one that achieves a specific result. (Functions)

Cheaper, more reliable, and faster

There are many applications of integrated circuits
